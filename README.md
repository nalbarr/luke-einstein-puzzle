### Context
This is main repository to group different implementations of the [Einstein puzzle](https://web.stanford.edu/~laurik/fsmbook/examples/Einstein%27sPuzzle.html).

NLA presented this to me as a bonus problem during one of his K-12 courses as a bonus problem.  At first, he was trying to solve it manually by handwriting notes like one would solve a Suduko puzzle.  I suggested we try writing a program together to solve it more formally.

At that point in time, I was actively taking Coursera John Hopkins Data Science specialization track and wanted to experiment how fast we could implement using a language I was less familiar with which as time was R.

Since then we decided to keep at an example or *kata* to try with different programming languages.

### The Problem
####  Facts:
1. Nicola lives in the tan house.  
2. Ed has a guinea pig.
